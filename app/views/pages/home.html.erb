      <h1>Who?</h1>
      <p>
        I'm a swiss web developer with a weakness for
        design and typography. In 2011 I cofounded
        <%= link_to "Codegestalt", "http://codegestalt.com" %>
        with two geeks I've met over Twitter. Since then
        we realized several projects together.
      </p>
      <p>
        My free time is sacrificed to improve my <%= link_to "photography skills", "http://flickr.com/photos/danielpuglisi" %> and
        to extend my film and book horizon. You can find some recommendations <%= link_to "here", "/recommendations" %>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I do and like a lot of other stuff, but I'm afraid those things are only half as interesting as the things you just read. But if you would like to hear more of it anyway, read on or <%= mail_to "daniel@codegestalt.com", "contact me" %>.

      <h1>What?</h1>
      <p>
        I've been designing and building web sites for over six years now & counting.
        When the sun is up I'm working for clients and when the sun is down I'm working
        on Codegestalt and personal projects like <%= link_to "Kreatify", "http://kreatify.com" %> &
        <%= link_to "Bridge", "http://bridgetalks.ch" %>.

        If you're interested in what I've done so far, switch over
        to the <%= link_to "work", "/work" %> page. Also I feel the urge to
        open up myself from time to time, which outputs
        in a more or less useful blog post which you'll find in the <%= link_to "articles", "/articles" %> section.

      <h1>Why?</h1>
      <p>
        Since learning new stuff is essential in life and makes a lot of fun, I'm constantly pushing myself to new heights.
        I love to experiment with new things and always try to redefine myself. Sometimes with a combination of old and new things.
      </p>
      <p>
        Knowing certain things doesn't just come to you, you have to earn it yourself with constant effort and by always taking the next step.
        I love that feeling when that *click* happens and suddenly everything turns from blur to high definition.
      </p>
      <p>
        I can't get enough of building and creating stuff.
        So if you like what I do and need someone to help you,
        don't be shy and <%= mail_to "daniel@codegestalt.com", "contact me" %>.
        I would love to help you <i class="icon-heart"></i>
